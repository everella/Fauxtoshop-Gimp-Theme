Adoughbe Fauxtoshop, a Gimp 2.10+ (GNU Image Manipulation Program) skin that mimics how Adobe Photoshop looks and operates.

# Features

- Overhauled GUI; Thin toolbox panel, thick dock tabs, Segoe UI (system font), Adobe dark color scheme, additional accent colors, etc

- Dark Adobe #161616 canvas padding color
  
- Faithful recreation of most Adobe Photoshop tool icons

- Nearly all of Adobe Photoshop's keyboard shortcuts
  
- Adobe themed splash screen & Gimp icon
  
- Extra quality-of-life keyboard shortcuts that enhance the user experience (e.g. pressing delete -> deletes whole layer instead of clearing layer)
  
- Adobe Photoshop themed tool-tips (sticky-note tool-tips)

- Bundled with the Resynthesizer Plugin (akin to content-aware) and G'MIC (advanced image processing)
