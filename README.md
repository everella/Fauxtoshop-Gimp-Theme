[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V1PJ9QW)

Adoughbe Fauxtoshop, a Gimp 2.10x (GNU Image Manipulation Program) skin that mimics how Adobe Photoshop looks and operates.

# Features

- Overhauled GUI; Thin toolbox panel, thick dock tabs, Segoe UI (system font), Adobe dark color scheme, additional accent colors, etc

- Dark Adobe #161616 canvas padding color
  
- Faithful recreation of most Adobe Photoshop tool icons

- Nearly all of Adobe Photoshop's keyboard shortcuts
  
- Adobe themed splash screen & Gimp icon
  
- Extra quality-of-life keyboard shortcuts that enhance the user experience (e.g. pressing delete -> deletes whole layer instead of clearing layer)
  
- Adobe Photoshop themed tool-tips (sticky-note tool-tips)

- Bundled with the Resynthesizer Plugin (akin to content-aware) and G'MIC (advanced image processing)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Fauxtoshop (Windows)

1. Download and install the latest stable release of Gimp [here](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) (as of writing, 2.10.34)

2. Visit the [releases](https://github.com/everella/Fauxtoshop-Gimp-Theme/tags) page here on github and download the .zip archive Fauxtoshop.zip

3. Extract the contents of the archive

4. Open Gimp 2.10.34. Once it is fully opened, close it.
   - Tip: Opening Gimp creates your Gimp's AppData Roaming and local folder, which are used for configuring gimp for themes, window placements, and more
    
5. Access your Gimp's Appdata Roaming folder
   - Typically located in ```C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\```
  
5.1. Drag and drop the Fauxtoshop ```2.10``` folder into your Gimp's AppData Roaming folder, and replace the files in the destination.
     - The goal here is to replace your original Gimp 2.10 folder with the Fauxtoshop 2.10 folder, which will convert the default Gimp layout to the Fauxtoshop one.

6. Access your Gimp's icons folder.
   - Typically found in ```C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\AppData\Local\Programs\Gimp 2.10\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\icons```

6.1. Within the Fauxtoshop folder, drag and drop the ```Adobe Photoshop '23``` folder into your Gimp's icons folder.
     - This installs the Fauxtoshop icons into Gimp.

7. Open Gimp.

8. Enjoy :)

Here is a 3 minute video demonstration on how to install it!


## üé® Want to go overboard on customization?

Install [Resource Hacker](https://angusj.com/resourcehacker/) and modify the Gimp 2.10.exe's details and internal app icon to make it not even mention Gimp at all. (Fauxtoshop .ico and .svg file is located in ```C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\z_design_logo```. Tutorial will not be provided here)

# Why Adoughbe Fauxtoshop?

I thought Adoughbe Fauxtoshop was a clever name. 

Adoughbe is named that way because it has ```ugh``` in it, which describes my distaste to Adobe (hence Ado-UGH-be). It also happens to sound like "Adobe", so that's cool.

Fauxtoshop is named that way because it is a very clever name I thought up of. Faux, meaning fake, is pronounced like Foe. When combined, it is Faux-toshop (foe-toe-shop), essentially meaning fakeshop, whilst also being pronounced the same way you would say "Photoshop."


On why I created Fauxtoshop, it was because I wanted to see if I can make Gimp as close as possible to Photoshop in terms of looks and functionality, and it seems as though it definitly is possible to get Gimp to closely mirror Adobe Photoshop.
