Adoughbe Fauxtoshop, a Gimp 2.10x (GNU Image Manipulation Program) skin that mimics how Adobe Photoshop looks and operates.

# Features

- Overhauled GUI; Thin toolbox panel, thick dock tabs, Segoe UI (system font), Adobe dark color scheme, additional accent colors, etc

- Dark Adobe #161616 canvas padding color
  
- Faithful recreation of most Adobe Photoshop tool icons

- Nearly all of Adobe Photoshop's keyboard shortcuts
  
- Adobe themed splash screen & Gimp icon
  
- Extra quality-of-life keyboard shortcuts that enhance the user experience (e.g. pressing delete -> deletes whole layer instead of clearing layer)
  
- Adobe Photoshop themed tool-tips (sticky-note tool-tips)

- Bundled with the Resynthesizer Plugin (akin to content-aware) and G'MIC (advanced image processing)

3. Extract the contents of the archive

4. Open Gimp 2.10.34. Once it is fully opened, close it.
  - Tip: Opening Gimp creates your Gimp's AppData Roaming and local folder, which are used for things like themes, window placements, etc

5. Drag the Fauxtoshop's Gimp 2.10 folder into your Gimp 2.10x AppData Roaming folder.

6. Open Gimp

7. Hit Edit -> Preferences, scroll down and hit the "Folders" drop down box.

8. Click on "Icon Themes."
   - There should be two folder paths. The top one should be the Gimp 2.10 Appdata Roaming folder. The Bottom one should be the Appdata Local folder.

9. Click the Appdata Local folder path (the bottom one).

10. Select the file cabinet icon (right most icon), or copy the given path in File Explorer.

11. Double click the "icons" folder, then drag and drop the "Adobe Photoshop '23" folder that was given in the Fauxtoshop.zip file.
